# Cascade Preidction

Please refer the link https://github.com/zhenhuascut/Cas2vec.
This is the link for codes and data used in the paper <Cascade2vec: Learning Dynamic Cascade Representation by Recurrent Graph Neural Networks.>. Since the paper is still under review, the codes will be fully released as soon as possible after the paper is published. The paper targets on cascade prediction, one of the fundemental problems in information diffusion. The problem is described in the following picture.

# Cascade Example
What is a cascade?
A cascade is also called information diffusion/dissemination networks. It records how information propagates between people. Examples of full cascades can be seen in the links https://github.com/zhenhuascut/diffusion-data.

# DataSet
## Sina Weibo Microblog Network 
The Microblog network dataset is used in our paper. It contains 119,313 messages in June 1, 2016. Each line contains the information of a certain message, the format of which is:
<message_id>\tab<user_id>\tab<publish_time>\tab<retweet_number>\tab<retweets>
<message_id>:     the unique id of each message, ranging from 1 to 119,313.
<root_user_id>:   the unique id of root user. The user id ranges from 1 to 6,738,040.
<publish_time>:   the publish time of this message, recorded as unix timestamp.
<retweet_number>: the total number of retweets of this message within 24 hours.
<retweets>:       the retweets of this message, each retweet is split by " ". Within each retweet, it records 
the entile path for this retweet, the format of which is <user1>/<user2>/......<user n>:<retweet_time>.

The dataset is from Prof. Shen, link https://github.com/CaoQi92/DeepHawkes

## APS Citation Network
The dataset includes the citation relationship between papers from 1893 and 2017 provided by American Physical Society (APS). The papers from 1893 to 1997 are selected to build cascades so that each of the papers is allowed to develop for at least 20 years. You are quired to send an email to the APS commit to get the dataset.

# Graph Perception Network

In the paper, we propose a new graph neural network called graph perception network (GPN), which achieves the state-of-the-art performance in graph classification tasks. 

The results between the GPN and baselines are as follows:

for example:
```
python the main_gpn.py --dataset 'MUTAG' --learningrate 0.005
```
The datasets can be chosen from ['COLLAB', 'NCI1', 'MUTAG', 'PTC', 'PROTEINS', 'IMDB-M', 'IMDB']

# Cascade2vec
When we run the cascade2vec in the Microblog network dataset provided by Prof. Shen in DeepHawkes CIKM'17.
Using the following command: 
```
python cascade_dynamic_main.py --T 1 --dataset=microblog --learningrate 0.0005
```
T=1 represents the observation time is 1 hour.

When T is set to 1 hour, the result looks like this:

# Model Parameters
The model parameters of Cascade2vec when batch_size=32 is around 44,000 when T=1 hour in the Microblog network dataset. However, the number of parameters of the compared methods DeepCas and DeepHawkes are 58.5 million and 69.5 million, respectively, since they have to learn a representation vector for each node. The number of users in the datasets is of millions.

# Requirements:
